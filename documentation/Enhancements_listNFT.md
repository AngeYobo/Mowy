The `listNFT` function in the `MowyMarketplace` contract involves adding several additional parameters and checks to cater to more professional and diverse use cases.

1. **Duration of Listing:**
   - Add a parameter to specify how long the NFT will be listed. Add a timestamp indicating when the listing will expire.
   - Implement logic to automatically delist the NFT after the expiration time.

2. **Approval Checks:**
   - Ensure that the marketplace contract is approved to transfer the NFT on behalf of the owner. This is critical for executing a sale.

3. **Listing Type:**
   - Introduce different types of listings, such as auction, fixed-price, or open to offers. Use an enum parameter.

4. **Reserve Price for Auctions:**
   - If implementing auctions, add a reserve price parameter to ensure that the NFT wonâ€™t be sold unless the bids exceed this price.

5. **Listing Metadata:**
   - Include additional metadata for the listing, such as a description to be helpful for potential buyers.

6. **Royalty Information:**
   - For NFTs with royalties, ensure that the royalty information is correctly handled and displayed as part of the listing.

7. **Batch Listing:**
   - Allow users to list multiple NFTs in a single transaction. This requires handling arrays of token IDs and prices.

8. **Conditional Listings:**
   - Implement conditions for listings, such as only allowing listing if certain criteria are met (e.g., time-based conditions, or based on the status of another contract).

9. **Verification or Certification:**
   - Introduce a mechanism to verify or certify certain listings, which can be an added feature for premium users or specific categories of NFTs.

10. **Customizable Fees:**
    - Allow for different fee structures based on the type of listing or seller status.

11. **Seller Whitelisting:**
    - Implement a whitelist system where only certain addresses are allowed to list NFTs.

12. **Event Emitters:**
    - Emit detailed events for listings that include all the relevant information.

Example of how the function signature could be modified to include some of these features:

```solidity
function listNFT(
    uint256 tokenId, 
    uint256 price, 
    uint256 duration, 
    ListingType listingType, 
    string memory metadata
) public {
    // Additional implementation
}
```

Additional feature, you should also consider the added complexity and gas costs. Always test thoroughly to ensure that the smart contract remains secure and efficient.
